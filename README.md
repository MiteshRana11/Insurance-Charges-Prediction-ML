# Insurance Charges Prediction App 💰📊 (Streamlit + Machine Learning)

This project is a simple Machine Learning application built during my **45-day AI/ML internship**.  
It predicts **medical insurance charges** based on user inputs such as age, sex, BMI, children, smoker status, and region.  
The model is trained using **Linear Regression** and the interactive web application is built using **Streamlit**.

## ▶️ How to Run This Project (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Download / Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MiteshRana11/Insurance-Charges-Prediction---ML.git

### Step 2: Open Project Folder
```bash
Go inside the Mitesh folder because the main Streamlit file is there:
cd Insurance-Charges-Prediction---ML/Mitesh

### Step 3: Install Required Libraries
```bash
pip install streamlit pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn

### Step 4: Run the Streamlit App
```bash
streamlit run user_interface.py

### Step 5: Open in Browser
```bash
Streamlit will open automatically, otherwise open:
http://localhost:8501
