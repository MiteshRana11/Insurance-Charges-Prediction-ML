# Insurance-Charges-Prediction---ML
# Insurance Charges Prediction App 💰📊

This is a simple Machine Learning project built during my 45-day AI/ML internship.  
The application predicts **medical insurance charges** based on user input like age, BMI, smoker status, region, etc.

The project is deployed locally using **Streamlit**, providing an interactive web interface.
