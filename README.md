This project is a simple Machine Learning application built during my **45-day AI/ML internship**.  
It predicts **medical insurance charges** based on user inputs such as age, sex, BMI, children, smoker status, and region.  
The model is trained using **Linear Regression** and the interactive web application is built using **Streamlit**.
